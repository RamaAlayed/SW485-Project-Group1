    "# Predicting Movie Success and Building a Recommendation System Using the IMDB Movie Dataset\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based recommendation system that predicts the success of a movie based on its features and provides personalized movie recommendations. \n",
    "The IMDB Movie Dataset will be used, which includes variables such as title, genre, description, director, actors, year, runtime, rating, and votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The movie industry is highly competitive. Predicting the success of a movie is crucial for stakeholders to plan effectively. \n",
    "This project aims at classifying movies into three categories based on their IMDB ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1-3 (Flop):** Low-rated movies  \n",
    "- **4-7 (Average/Niche):** Moderately rated movies or movies with niche appeal  \n",
    "- **>7 (Success):** Highly rated and successful movies  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, clustering techniques will be used to group similar movies for recommendation purposes.\n"
